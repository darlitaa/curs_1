        <h1>
        Free Cities and vicinity
        </h1>
            <p>
                Across the Narrow sea on the western side of Essos lie the nine Free Cities,
                independent city-states that are mostly on islands or along the coast. They are Lys,
                Myr, Pentos, Braavos, Lorath, Norvos, Qohor, Volantis and Tyrosh. Although most Free Cities
                are named early in the first novel, the books only provide a map of this region in A Dance with Dragons.
                Mountains to the east separate the coast from the plains of the Dothraki Sea, though gaps in the mountain
                range provide the Dothraki people some access to the Free Cities. The Free Cities were colonies built by the
                ancient Valyrian Freehold, and later declared independence after the Doom of Valyria. An exception to this is Braavos,
                which was founded by refugees fleeing Valyrian expansion, escaped slaves and other rabble. The languages of the Free Cities
                are derivatives of High Valyrian.
            <p>
                The Free Cities span an area characterized by the river Rhoyne, which the local character Yandry describes as "the greatest
                river in the world".[65] Its banks are the homeland of the Rhoynar, who worship the river as "Mother Rhoyne".
                As mapped in A Dance with Dragons, the Rhoyne originates from the conjunction of two of its tributaries, the Upper Rhoyne
                and the Little Rhoyne, southeast of the ruins of Ghoyan Drohe. The headwaters of the Upper Rhoyne lie in Andalos, the homeland
                of the Andals between Braavos and Pentos. The Rhoyne's course runs southeast to turn due south after Dagger Lake, where river
                pirates hide on and around the many lake islands.[68] The Rhoyne gains in width considerably as it gets fed by more tributaries, 
                until it opens into the Summer Sea in a delta near the Free City of Volantis.

        <h2>
            Dorne
        </h2>
            <p>
                Dorne is the southernmost and least populated land of Westeros. The capital, Sunspear, is the seat of the ruling House Martell. 
                As of the first five books, Doran Nymeros Martell is the Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear. Doran's sister, Princess Elia, was married 
                in a political alliance to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne. They had two children, a daughter, 
                Rhaenys, and a son, Aegon. During the Sack of King's Landing at the end of Robert's Rebellion, Princess Elia was raped and murdered by Gregor 
                Clegane, a House Lannister bannerman (vassal). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Her children were also killed in front of her. Prince Doran and his wife, Princess Mellaria, 
                have three children, Arianne, Quentyn and Trystane. During the War of the Five Kings, Tyrion Lannister, as Hand of the King, turns the historical 
                enmity of House Martell and Dorne into an alliance by sending King Joffrey's middle sibling and sister, Myrcella Baratheon, as the betrothed 
                future bride to Trystane, the youngest child of Prince Doran, who is about her own age. The eldest child of Prince Doran, Arianne, is heir to 
                House Martell, Sunspear and the rule of Dorne. The wealth of Dorne comes from their famous Sand Steeds, purebred horses of endurance, speed, 
                and grace, and from spices, wines, fishing, fabrics, and textiles.
